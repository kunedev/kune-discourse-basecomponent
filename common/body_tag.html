    ANALYSIS: 

		THE 2 X JS FILES ARE NEEDED FOR MMENU TO WORK AND FOR TOP MENU TO WORK.  JQUERY ALSO NEEDED. 

		EITHER OF THE 2 X JS FILES SEEMS TO BREAK THE STICKY BEHAVIOUR, THO. 

			THE SOLUTION HERE:  KEEP JQUERY AND MMENU.  FIX THE "STICKY" BEHAVIOUR ISSUE LATER, IGNORE FOR NOW. 
		
		THE FILTER BEHAVIOUR FOR SETTINGS IS DRIVEN BY CUSTOM SETTINGS PLUGINS (MAY BE LINKED TO THE ABSENCE OF A DESCRIPTION?) 
		
			THE SOLUTION: IGNORE FOR NOW, IT SEEMS TO BE LIMITED TO JUST THIS SINGLE NON-CRITICAL PROBLEM 
			
    -> Minor issue / MMenu CSS (demo) breaks Reports page (and probably elsewhere). 
        
        todo: fix with custom CSS.
